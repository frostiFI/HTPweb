<h1>Notes to demo version of 360 webpages</h1>
<p>This site is created to demonstrate the advantages, potential and obstacles of presenting different sites with 360 degree photographs. It's purpose is to serve as a base for learning and future projects. Some descriptions and information may need future improvement.</p>

<p>The demo web pages show different styles and possible issues. To accomplish that, it includes also images with questionable quality that may not be suitable for public presentation and marketing in the future.</p>

<h3>Weather outside</h3>
<p>The most obvious challenge is the weather and seasons at the time of the shooting. Both heavily influence the quality of the images and the mood of the website: from sunny autumn at Miehinkäisen luontopolku, over the rainy day at Kontionjälki, to foggy midday at Huutoniemi.</p>
<p>The rain and darkness can very negatively influence an image. In general, the 360 cameras take worse quality images than regular cameras. Therefor, it can have more problems with darkness or uneven lighting. The lower light conditions can result in a bad focus or a visible quality difference between the image from the two separate camera lenses. It is not possible to simply use a camera flashlight in one direction. Any artificial lighting needs to be done at large scale relatively evenly in all directions, or at least equally for both lenses.</p>
<p>The raindrops on cover of camera lenses are very visible on some pictures from <a href="Kontionjalki/index.html">Kontionjälki</a>, for example at <b>Konttilampi</b>. On other images the presence of raindrops also causes the camera focus not to work properly and the image is not sharp enough (bad quality). This is worsened by the lack of light at rainy day, for example at the <b>Laavu</b>.</p>
<!-- TO BE ADDED: A night image at Leinikinpuisto from Valon kylä.-->


<h3>The shooting of the 360 images</h3>
<p> Since the image captures all around the camera, the camera stand is often visible as well. Some attempts to cover the stand in time of the shooting with the bark can be seen on the images from the <a href="EsapetajanLP/index.html">Esapetäjän luontopolku</a>.
</p>
<p> 
On the image <b>Ympäristö</b> is well seen the distortion that can happen from the stitching together the two images from the two separate camera lenses. On the opposite side of the image from the ant hill, there can be seen strangely shaped trees with a ghost double.
</p>
<p> 
The capture of objects from up close works very nicely with a flat image, but it can provide unwanted results with the 360 camera. The objects very close to the camera can appear huge compared to reality, especially when viewed by VR glasses. Some examples are on image <b>Lähellä</b> from the <a href="EsapetajanLP/index.html">Esapetäjän luontopolku</a><!-- and on image of museum-->.
</p>

<h3>Changes to 360 images</h3>
<p>Editing of the 360 images is possible, but the results from the freely available programs can be of questionable quality. This is caused by editing the 360 images in 2D-flat format. A visible distortion of the image is greatest at the bottom part and the top part of an image, which makes editing difficult at those parts. This can be seen at <a href="Kontionjalki/index.html">Kontionjälki</a> site on images <b>Tonttu</b> and <b>Polku</b>, where the large stand of the camera was (rather badly) edited out on bottom of the pictures.</p>
<p>There is however still a possibility to include in the 360 images some signs or logos as can be seen at <a href="SorvasenLT/index.html">Sorvasen lintutorni</a> site with the Hyvän Tuulen paja logo. This works the best in the middle of the images' height, where occurs almost no distortion after editing even in 2D editing programs.</p>

<h3>Webpages</h3>
<p>The pages with images are generated with a free online tool. The tool allows placing an Info hotspot and a Link hotspot to any part of the image. It also allows to set an initial view of the image. There are however some limitations, e.g. the Info hotspot can not include working links (e.g. to other websites) or pictures. </p>
<p>The colour of texts, menus, backgrounds and also the shape of buttons can be changed from the default generated by the used tool. Each nature trail can have its own style or all can share the same style together. These changes however require some post-processing and at least a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other technologies. The same knowledge is required for creation of the additional pages with text, where different styles and colours can be used.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For more complicated changes or options might be needed to use different tools and software.</p>
